### Summary
- This filter has difficulty to find parameter. For example, a user would need to go through the table to find the city for desired analysis.
- It would be better to build the Filters with drop down selection, so that a user does not need to look through the tables.
- Also if the Table's columns has **Decending** or **Acending** order function would be good to have. For example as clicking **State** on the Table, the table changes alpaphet order A-Z, one more click makes Z-A order.
